# Class 2 - React
## Assignment 1 Instructions
Use React and the `chart`, `peeps`, and `books` data in `App.js` to display a list of people alongside the book they liked.


## Assignment 2 Instructions
Let's do something a little bit more complicated. Instead of displaying a
list of users and their movies, this time you need to display a list of movies.

For each book in the list, there are two options:

1. If the book has been liked by any of the peeps, then display a list of all of the peeps who said that they liked that book.
2. If the book has *not* been liked, display some text stating that no one liked this book.

As you go about tackling this project, try to make the app *modular* by breaking it into resusable React components.
